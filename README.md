# GorillaGUI

A Java Swing GUI to support Honors IT's Windows software management tool Gorilla.

The code component is mostly made by the NetBeans IDE through its amazing and convenient GUI building tools.

This GUI is expected to be able to add, update, and delete applications currently being deployed by Gorrilla for Honors's Windows computer system. Inspired by Munki's GUI for Mac software management, I want to further my Gorrilla effort by making a GUI so that future IT workers can easily manage Gorilla without former programming knowledge.

Gorrilla is made by github.com/1dustindavis.
